Hey Gennady,

Finally, I could happily share two more results (Exp.II and Exp.III) for fitting and simulations. The position of grating is a bit different as to compare with last experiment. In current Exp.II the distance from grating to the CCD is 
about 60 mm, i.e. ca. 20 mm more far and, as result, we see less orders in the detector plane.

I have digged into saturated pixels. Here my shot summary about it:
in the last experiment Exp.I (T_exp = 20 s)  we had 58 saturated pixels with intensity 65535 cts in just three orders "0", "-1" and "3". Now in the new image Exp.II (T_exp =5 s) I found 34 (50% less) saturated pixels, and all of them are 
in "0"-order only (bottom one). The "1"-st oder (top one) looks also like it has saturated  pixels, however it actually has no 65535 cts.
The images I send you are processed with background is substraction. Hence there are no 65535 cts, but you could detected them as so called "flat-tops".

Attached are two original raw images in ASCII-format:

Exp.II_grating-at-10-deg-lin.7z
Exp.III_grating-at-05-deg-lin.7z

In the separate attached pdf (Exp_II_III-geometry-settings.pdf) described our geometry, try to keep same definitions, as it was for previous experiment "Exp.I".

Exp.II (10 deg incidence): Exposure  time T_exp = 5 s.
there are two central peaks, both could be specular but only the bottom one has really saturated pixels (with values 65535 cts).

In Exp.III (5 deg incidence): Exposure  time T_exp = 2 s.
here no saturated pixels found.
At the experiment time, I was looking more into fine structure resulted from scattering, so I let it some peaks be saturated, and there are exposure even 60s (attached with several views) 

Note that Matlab's processed images are flipped over y-axis (1st pixel on the top left corner) (inset images in pdf )

Looking forward if the simulation will converge better now. Ready to connect in Skype at anytime.

Best wishes,
Oleksiy
